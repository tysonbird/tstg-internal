From the remote mountains of Big Bend to the dense forests of the Piney Woods, and the warm waters of the Gulf Coast to the refreshing rivers of the Hill Country, Texas boasts an enticing array of landscapes to explore. As any longtime Texan will tell you, there is no better way to experience the vastness and diversity of the state than behind the wheel of your car. Encompassing 254 counties and 268,597 square miles, the second-largest state in the country offers a seemingly endless number of routes and itineraries. Whether you want to explore the region’s rich history, experience its diverse cultural offerings, or dine at nationally acclaimed restaurants, the Lone Star State rewards every kind of traveler.  
  
In addition to listings for more than 2,400 attractions in nearly 500 cities, the 2023 Travel Guide includes themed and regional road-trip itineraries. Opportunities for adventure abound: Hike five Texas peaks, explore film and TV locations, seek year-round opportunities to view wildflowers, or shop for distinctive gifts at small town mom-and-pop stores. So gas up your car, prep your favorite tunes, and get ready to be inspired by the open road.

**Above**: The 2023 Texas State Travel Guide and Texas Official Travel Map covers feature the Juan Velázquez mural “Dancing with you” painted on the wall of the Original Del Norte restaurant at the corner of North Main Street and Central Avenue in Fort Worth.

The photos are the work of Bowie-based photographer Dave Shafer. More of his photographs of Fort Worth can be seen on the [Texas Highways Website](https://texashighways.com/travel/theres-never-been-a-better-time-to-visit-fort-worth).

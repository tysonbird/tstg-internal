More than 6 million Texas households have a furry (or scaly, or feathered, or gilled) friend to call their own. Many owners wonder how to care for their pet while traveling. Boarding can cost a small fortune, and they may be wary of leaving their animal with a stranger. Whether by car, camper van, or plane, people are increasingly opting to take their pets on the road. This guide—though not comprehensive—features curated recommendations for pet owners seeking fun getaways across the state. From far West Texas to the Piney Woods, each region offers travelers a tailored stay, no matter their species.
